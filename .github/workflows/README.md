## Comments That Trigger Workflows
- Commenting `/retest` (without any other text) on a PR will trigger the [retest](./retest.yaml) job (limited to kgateway org members only). This will re-run any failed jobs from the latest workflow runs on the PR.
- Commenting `/merge` (without any other text) on a PR will trigger the [enable auto-merge](./automerge.yaml) job (limited to kgateway org members only). This will enable auto-merge for the PR.
- Commenting `/unmerge` (without any other text) on a PR will trigger the [disable auto-merge](./automerge.yaml) job (limited to kgateway org members only). This will disable auto-merge for the PR.
