// CheckWriterIdempotent asserts the fixed-point invariant the whole status pipeline rests

//
// Every status write we make echoes back as an informer event on the collection that
// enqueues the resource, so the writer is always asked a second time about the status it
// just wrote. The only thing that terminates that cycle is the writer's live-vs-desired
// skip, which holds exactly when rebuilding from what we wrote reproduces what we wrote:
//
//	Merge(current, Desired(current)) applied to current == Merge(next, Desired(next))
//
// A builder that stamps a fresh LastTransitionTime on an unchanged condition, or that
// renormalizes (sorts, defaults, re-cases) entries it copied from the live object, breaks
// that equality and converts the designed one-shot echo into a permanent write loop against
// the API server — one that no test of the skip mechanism alone will catch, because the skip
// is working correctly and simply never fires.
//
// It returns nil when the writer would not write at all (no desired status, or already up to
// date): nothing was published, so there is nothing to converge from.
//
// Every writer registered with the status pipeline should run this, including downstream
// writers added via WithStatusRegistration — the invariant is a property of the pipeline,
// not of the writers that shipped with it.
// res must be the identity the writer is registered under, since that is what its Desired
// keys its report lookup on.
