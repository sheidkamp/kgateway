#  - HTTP listener on port 8090
#
# Parent infra/root:
#   - Delegate /anything/team1 to team1 namespace
#   - Delegate /anything/team2 to team2 namespace
#
# Child team1/svc1:
#   - Route /anything/team1/foo to team1/svc1
#   - No parentRefs
#
# Child team2/svc2:
#   - Route /anything/team2/foo to team2/svc2
