# Configuration:
#
# Parent infra/root:
#   - Delegate /anything/team1 to team1 namespace
#   - Delegate /anything/team2 to team2-root namespace
#
# Child team1/svc1:
#   - Route /anything/team1/foo to team1/svc1
#   - No parentRefs
#
# Child team2-root/team2-root:
#   - Delegate /anything/team2/ to all routes team2 namespace
#   - Parent infra/root
#
#   Child team2/svc2:
#     - Delegate /anything/team2/foo to routes in team2 namespace
#     - Cyclic delegation as it selects itself!
